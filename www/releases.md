### About this app
<br>
<p style=" font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">
This application creates two plots that provide insight into the increase in the accuracy of estimates of the mean 
                         as sampling intensity is increased. The first graph plots percent error of the estimate of the mean of a forest attribute 
                         (e.g., basal area, above-ground biomass) as a function of sampling intensity. This plot can be used to determine the sample 
                         size necessary to achieve a desired accuracy for the estimate of a mean. The second graph is a plot of the confidence interval 
                         around the estimate of the mean. The lower bound, point estimate, and upper bound appear as functions of sampling intensity. 
                         An individual stratum can be specified so that these plots are specific to the estimate of the mean in the specified stratum.
